## Project Definiton

### Project Overview
This project identifies 3 main customer segments with K-Means clustering: Low-Value Low-Frequency, High-Value Low-Frequency, and Low-Value High-Frequency Users. Furthermore, sub-segmentation and prioritization of the clusters are based on recency. 

The variable selection process for clustering is done by both PCA and business intuition. The clusters generated are evaluated with Silhouette Coefficient and statistical analysis. In following up with this, recommendations for marketing reactivation is provided based on recency and characteristics of different segments.
